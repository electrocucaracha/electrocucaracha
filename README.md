scale and adapt. Iâ€™m a fervent supporter of the Open Source and have
successfully lead teams using Agile methodologies.

- âš¡ Fun fact: During my university studies I worked on a TV repair
shop. We cleaned them up before fixing and usually we discovered many
interesting things along the disassembly process. That's where this
nickname came from.
