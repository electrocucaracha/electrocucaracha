Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer with an interest in automated
software development. I enjoy building solutions that are easy to use,
scale and adapt. Iâ€™m a fervent supporter of the Open Source and have
successfully lead teams using Agile methodologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Samsung as Senior Staff Software
Engineer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/),
[OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org/), [ONAP](https://www.onap.org/) and
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: During my university studies I worked on a TV repair
shop. We cleaned them up before fixing and usually we discovered many
interesting things along the disassembly process. That's where this
nickname came from.
